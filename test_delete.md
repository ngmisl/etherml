# Delete Functionality Test

## What was fixed:
1. **Added confirmation mode**: `confirmingDelete` and `walletToDelete` fields to model
2. **Added DeleteWallet method**: Removes wallet from storage and saves file
3. **Added confirmation logic**: Handles y/N response in Update function  
4. **Added confirmation view**: Shows delete confirmation screen
5. **Fixed delete trigger**: Sets confirmation mode instead of just showing message

## How to test:
1. Run `./wallet` with password `test123`
2. Press `d` on a wallet to delete
3. Press `y` to confirm or `n`/`Esc` to cancel
4. Verify wallet is removed from list

## Expected behavior:
- `d` key shows confirmation screen with wallet details
- `y` deletes the wallet and refreshes the list  
- `n` or `Esc` cancels the deletion
- Status messages show success/failure/cancellation

The delete functionality should now work properly with proper confirmation.
